Fuzzy inference system of the self-driving car (Mega) to navigate               
through a simulated urban environment â€“ Report  

Mega 

Mega is a self-driving car which is developed to do its driving process without a driver by its own 
intelligence. Mega is equipped with an intelligent decision-making system powered by a fuzzy inference 
system. This system enables Mega to navigate seamlessly through a complex and dynamic simulated 
urban environment and making real-time decisions based on a combination of inputs. 
Mega is developed to maintain its own speed according to the speed limit of the urban area which a 
vehicle can have within that area.    
And to avoid an obstacle presence in front.  
These inputs are obtained by car sensors from the road signs.
